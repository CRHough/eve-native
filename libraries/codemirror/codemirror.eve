# CodeMirror

This library creates instances of CodeMirror editors that can be used to 
display and edit code. It includes a custom [Eve mode][1] for CodeMirror.


## Creating a code block

We create a code-block with a default value and id.

search
  block = [#codemirror/code-block]
  //value = if block.value then block.value else ""
  mode = if block.mode then block.mode else ""
watch client/websocket
  ("code-block/create", block, mode)
end

Code blocks are given tagged as `#html/element` so they will be rendered in the
DOM. We replace this element with a CodeMirror instance, and sync its value 
property with the value stored in Eve.

search
  block = [#codemirror/code-block]
bind
  block <- [#html/element tagname: "div"]
end


## Create an Eve block

With a different tag, we can create a block configured for Eve code

search
  eve-block = [#codemirror/eve-block]
bind
  eve-block <- [#codemirror/code-block mode: "eve"]
end


## Updating a code block

When we've gotten an update from the client, apply it to the original record,
keeping them in sync.

search
  change = [#codemirror/code-block/change block new-value]
  block = [#codemirror/code-block value]
commit
  change := none
  block.value := new-value
end

If `value` changes in Eve, we need to sync that in the rendered version

search
  block = [#codemirror/code-block value]
watch client/websocket
  ("code-block/update", block, value)
end
