Setup
-------------

Some angles to display:

~~~eve
search
  angle = math/range[from: 0 to: 360]
  color = if angle < 90 then "green"
          else if angle < 180 then "yellow"
          else "red"
commit
  [#angle angle color sort: angle]
end
~~~

The canvas to draw to:

~~~eve
commit
  [#canvas/root #my-canvas width: 200 height: 50 children:
    [#canvas/path children:
      [type: "arc" x: 50 y: 50 radius: 20 startAngle: 0 endAngle: 1.5 * 3.14]]]
end
~~~

Main Stuff
-------------

For each angle, make a row with its color and value, and a button to
dray it to the canvas.

~~~eve
search
  angle = [#angle degrees color]
bind
  [#ui/row angle sort: angle.sort style: [color width: "100px"] | children:
    [#ui/button text: "draw" angle]
    [#ui/text text: "Angle of " + degrees + " degrees"]]
end
~~~
